<!--

- My vision was when mentee/mentor is selected, name is typed, then when submitted is pressed
  it will show all people with the same "characters"? that is searched
- ex: Typed: "bob" -> Bob, Bobby, Bobbison ; will all pop up
- Im having trouble getting it to detect the dropdown
- I am leaving all my code for you to look at
- You can probably get rid of the id=results,
  I know with normal html when you href="search.html#results" it will send to the results id (line 30)
  , but it didnt doesnt really work with our site

Code I affected (lines might not be the same once I push)
-  main.py line85-111
- forms.py line68-75
- db_models.py line101-105

for main.py, I was trying to get stuff to work using queries but it wasnt going to plan
- also imported request and SearchForm
